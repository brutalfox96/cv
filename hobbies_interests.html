    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Computer Programming</strong> <br />
        I program mostly in Python and enjoy making probability simulations, differential equation solvers and data analysis projects.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Table Tennis</strong> <br />
        I have been playing table tennis for 2 years and hope to train with the University of Leeds team when Covid-19 lockdown
        restrictions are relaxed.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Buddhism</strong> <br />
        Before lockdown restrictions closed most public spaces, I was a regular attender of the Manchester Buddhist Centre, a community
        of followers of the Triratna school of Buddhism.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Cooking</strong> <br />
        My most recent cooking interest has been in fermenting foods. Fermentation overlaps with my evolution-based philosophy to health
        and is a delicious way of eating lots of raw vegetables. So far I have fermented my own Sriracha sauce, Sauerkraut and Beetroot,
        and plan on making some fermented pickles soon.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Interests</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Evolutionary Health</strong> <br />
        Over the past year I have been thinking more about how to live a healthy life. Recently I discovered 'The Primal Blueprint'
        by Mark Sisson and have been inspired by his assertion that the optimum way to lead a healthy lifestyle is to emulate the
        behaviour of our ancestors (10,000B.C., before the advent of agriculture). I am thinking of ways to implement his rules for
        living into my own life, where money and job place constraints on the extent to which I can follow the blueprint.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Financial Independence and Frugality</strong> <br />
        I am a follower of the Mr. Money Mustache blog, which preaches living a frugal lifestyle and investing saved income to be able to
        reach Financial Independence and retire young.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Digital Minimalism</strong> <br />
        I am a big fan of Cal Newport's work, in particular Deep Work, and subscribe to the digital minimalist philosophy, which states
        that the value of a particular technology in one's life should be heavily scrutinised and only if the tool has substantial
        overall worth should it be incorporated. As a result of this, I decided several years ago to delete all of my social media accounts.
        My minimalist lifestyle has recently evolved to replacing televsion and video games with non-digitised forms of entertainment.
